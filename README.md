8) Minimum platforms(gfg) : sort arrival and departure arrays independently. Take 2 iterators on both arrival and departure arrays i,j starting from 0. Take a count variable to track the amount of platforms needed currently. If arr[i]<=dep[j] it means a new train has arrived and we need to increment the existing count. if dep[j]<arr[i] then it means an already existing train on a platform has departed so we can decrement the count of platforms by 1. Track the maximum possible value of count while doing this and also stop the loop once we need end of either arrival or departure array.
